\title{Games Howell Post-hoc Tests}
\usage{
games_howell_test(data, formula, conf.level = 0.95,
  p.adjust.method = "holm", detailed = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a data.frame containing the variables in the formula.}

\item{formula}{a formula of the form \code{x ~ group} where \code{x} is a
numeric variable giving the data values and \code{group} is a factor with
one or multiple levels giving the corresponding groups. For example,
\code{formula = TP53 ~ cancer_group}.}

\item{conf.level}{confidence level of the interval.}

\item{p.adjust.method}{method to adjust p values for multiple comparisons.
Used when pairwise comparisons are performed. Allowed values include "holm",
"hochberg", "hommel", "bonferroni", "BH", "BY", "fdr", "none". If you don't
want to adjust the p value (not recommended), use p.adjust.method = "none".}

\item{detailed}{logical value. Default is FALSE. If TRUE, a detailed result is
shown.}
}
\value{
return a data frame with some of the following columns: \itemize{
 \item \code{.y.}: the y (outcome) variable used in the test. \item
 \code{group1,group2}: the compared groups in the pairwise tests. \item
 \code{n1,n2}: Sample counts. \item \code{estimate, conf.low, conf.high}:
 mean difference and its confidence intervals. \item \code{statistic}: Test
 statistic (t-value) used to compute the p-value. \item \code{df}: degrees of
 freedom calculated using Welchâ€™s correction. \item \code{p}: p-value.
 \item \code{method}: the statistical test used to compare groups. \item
 \code{p.signif}: the significance level of p-values. }

 The \strong{returned object has an attribute called args}, which is a list
 holding the test arguments.

\description{
Performs Games-Howell test, which is used to compare all possible
 combinations of group differences when the assumption of homogeneity of
 variances is violated. This post hoc test provides confidence intervals for
 the differences between group means and shows whether the differences are
 statistically significant.
}
\details{
The p-values are computed from the studentized range distribution.
